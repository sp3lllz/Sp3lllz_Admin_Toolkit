# Sp3lllz_Admin_Toolkit

## Welcome!
Hello there, welcome to my toolkit of scripts that i have written over the years. I have worked in the IT industry for over 10 years now and over that time have accumulated various scripts that I have written to help fix issues that have arose throughout my career. I decided that if these are useful for me they must be usful for others too and such I started this github repository and make it open source under the MIT licence please feel free to use these scripts for whatever your use may be (within the confines of that license of course).

Please see the below index for a list of the scripts included in this and a breif description of each as well as any prerequisites to running a script
